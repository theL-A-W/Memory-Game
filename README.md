# Memory-Game
Create a memory game using an image API

How it works:

You can choose from any of the 5 decks:
The gameboard consists of 24 cards(images will change depending on which deck you have chosen)

The chosen deck of 24 cards are flipped image-side down. 
- Click two cards that you think will match to flip them over.
- If they match, they stay flipped over and can't be clicked again.
- If they do not match they revert to image-side down and you click again
The game  ends when all cards are matched or the timer runs out.

Stretch goals:
- A hint option, where the card with the same ID as the one flipped over will move to 2pixels in the Y direction until clicked(for easy mode only)..
- Add a randomized dad joke to the “winner” band that pops up in the hard mode
- Shuffle the images for hard mode every 20 seconds
