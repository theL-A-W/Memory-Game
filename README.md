How it works:
The gameboard consists of 24 cards
The deck of 24 cards begins image-side down.
-  Choose between easy and hard mode by clicking the associated button. The game is set to default to easy mode.
- Click two cards that you think will match to "flip them over" and show the images.
- If they match, the cards will stay flipped over.
- If they do not match they revert to image-side down and you repeat, clicking the cards with no images unitl all cards have been matched.
- The game ends when all cards are matched or the timer runs out.
- Win the game, and claim your prize at the end(hint: your prize is a joke)

- "Hard" mode update, including: the addition of a 25th card to the deck as a joker card that, when clicked on will remove 20s econds from the timer.
- Audio for every card click
- A hint option for easy mode. After you click the first card, if you wait longer than 5 seconds before choosing the partner card it will wiggle(move up by 2px repeatedly).
